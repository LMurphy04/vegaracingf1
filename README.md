## Vega Racing F1iS

This is the code repository for the [`Vega Racing Website`](https://vegaracingf1.vercel.app).

The website is built using [`React`](https://react.dev) and the [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org) framework, styled using [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com). This allowed for easy development of fast, interactive, and responsive content. Some components are created using [`Mantine`](https://mantine.dev/) (a UI component library), and the 3D Car Museum is created with [`React-Three-Fiber`](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/) and [`React-Three-Drei`](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was used to help with error catching during development.

Best of Luck to Vega Racing in the 2024 F1iS World Finals!
