        Hi, we’re Vega Racing, a professional class F1 in Schools team! This
        year we’re representing Scotland at the 2024 World Finals in Saudi
        Arabia, and we’d love to take you along for the ride.

        What is F1 in Schools? F1 in Schools is an international youth
        competition with a focus on STEM, where teams of students design, build
        and race miniature F1 cars. Alongside this, teams must produce
        portfolios covering their engineering and enterprise work, a pit
        display, a verbal presentation and fundraise to support their F1 in
        Schools journey. F1 in Schools offers students the chance to enter the
        world of STEM, form contacts in F1, and learn practical skills they can
        apply in later careers. Through both its industry partners and close
        connection to F1, the competition has offered many a pathway into
        working in the sport, an opportunity we are eager to take ourselves!

        About Us We’re a professional class F1 in Schools team formed of six
        students from Linlithgow Academy, competing in the 2024 World Finals.
        Previously, we’ve won the Scottish Regional Finals before coming 2 nd in
        the UK National Finals, allowing us to qualify for Worlds! We’re hugely
        community oriented, supporting the F1 in Primary Schools competition in
        our local area and partnering with local businesses to succeed together.
        We never would have been able to progress to the massive stage of Worlds
        without our community’s backing, so we hope to continue our crucial link
        with them into the future.
